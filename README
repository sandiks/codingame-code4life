A game is played with 2 players. Each player controls one robot.

The complex is composed of 3 modules named DIAGNOSIS, MOLECULES and LABORATORY. 
The robots can transfer two types of items from and to the modules: sample data files and molecules.

In a nutshell, you have to optimize your robot movements to:
Collect sample data files from the cloud at the DIAGNOSIS module.
Gather required molecules for the medicines at the MOLECULES module.
Produce the medicines at the LABORATORY module and collect your health points.


The robots
Each player has one robot. Both robots have the same starting position.
A robot can carry up to 3 sample data files and 10 molecules.
A player can move their robot from one module to another by means of the GOTO module command.
Once the robot is at a module's interface, it can connect to it with the CONNECT command. This will have a different effect for each module.
Sample data
A sample data file is an item representing all known data on a tissue sample collected from an untreated patient. Researching this sample may ultimately lead to the production of medicine to prolong the lives of all patients with the same ailment.
A sample data is associated with the list of molecules needed to produce the medicine for that sample.
A sample data will grant you a variable number of health points when you research it.
Molecules
A molecule can be one of five types: A, B, C, D or E.
